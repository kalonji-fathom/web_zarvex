You are a web developer building a professional static website for ZARVEX GLOBAL (Pty) Ltd, a B2B mineral processing and industrial equipment supplier based in South Africa.

**Your Task:**
Create a static website (HTML and CSS only) that will be deployed on GitHub Pages. The site should establish ZARVEX GLOBAL as a credible supplier to mining operators, mineral processing consultants, plant builders, and engineering workshops primarily in Gauteng, North West, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and the Free State.

**Website Structure:**
Build the following pages using semantic HTML5:
- `index.html` - Professional homepage introducing the company and its value proposition
- `products.html` - Showcase the three product categories: mineral processing equipment, laboratory/pilot-scale equipment, and industrial/engineering supplies
- `about.html` - Company background, target customers, and service regions (South Africa focus, potential SADC expansion)
- `contact.html` - Contact form and warehouse location (6 Knights Road, Germiston, Gauteng, 1400)
- A single CSS file (`style.css`) that styles all pages with a cohesive, professional design

**Design Requirements:**
- Professional B2B aesthetic appropriate for industrial/mining sector
- Mobile-responsive design that works on all devices
- Clean navigation header that appears on all pages
- Footer with contact information and warehouse address
- Color scheme and typography that conveys reliability and professionalism
- No JavaScript—CSS and HTML only
- Accessibility best practices (semantic HTML, alt text for any images/icons, proper heading hierarchy)

**Content Guidance:**
- Homepage should clearly communicate that ZARVEX GLOBAL is a supplier of mineral processing equipment, laboratory equipment, and industrial supplies to the mining and metallurgical sectors
- Products page should organize offerings into the three main categories with brief descriptions
- About page should emphasize B2B focus, regional expertise, and customer base (SMEs, operators, consultants, workshops)
- Contact page should include the warehouse address and a simple contact form
- Tone: Professional, trustworthy, direct—no marketing fluff

**Deployment Setup:**
Include a `README.md` file with instructions for deploying to GitHub Pages, and ensure the file structure is GitHub Pages-compatible (standard HTML/CSS in root or docs folder).

Build this as a complete, production-ready website ready to deploy immediately.
